Health Assistant: AI-Powered Disease Risk Prediction
Overview
Health Assistant is a smart, web-based application that helps individuals assess their risk of developing three common diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease. By leveraging machine learning, the platform provides a quick, accessible, and non-invasive way for users to understand potential health risks and take proactive steps toward better health.

Key Features
✅ Easy-to-Use Interface – Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.
✅ Multi-Disease Prediction – Get insights into your risk of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease.
✅ AI-Powered Analysis – Uses trained machine learning models for accurate risk assessments.
✅ Clear & Informative Visuals – Easy-to-understand results that help users make informed decisions.

Technologies Used
🔹 Programming Language: Python
🔹 Web Framework: Streamlit
🔹 Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
🔹 Development Environments: Google Colab, Spyder (Anaconda)

sh
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py  
5️⃣ Open the Provided URL in Your Browser and start using the app!

How to Use
🟢 Step 1: Select a prediction category from the sidebar:
    📌 Diabetes Prediction
    📌 Heart Disease Prediction
    📌 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction

🟢 Step 2: Enter the requested health details.

🟢 Step 3: Click "Predict" to receive your results.

🟢 Step 4: The AI analyzes your data and provides a disease risk prediction based on medical patterns.

Machine Learning Models Used
Diabetes Prediction – Based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on medical datasets.
Heart Disease Prediction – Uses Logistic Regression to evaluate heart disease risk.
Parkinson’s Disease Prediction – Uses an SVM model trained on voice and movement-related health data.
Limitations & Disclaimer
❌ Not a Replacement for Medical Advice: The tool provides insights but is not a medical diagnosis. Always consult a healthcare professional.
❌ Data-Based Predictions: Results are generated based on machine learning models and available datasets, which may not capture all possible health conditions.

Future Enhancements
🚀 Wearable Device Integration – Connect with fitness trackers for real-time health monitoring.
🤖 AI Chatbot Support – An interactive assistant to guide users through the prediction process.
📈 Enhanced Model Accuracy – Incorporating deep learning techniques and larger datasets for even better predictions.
