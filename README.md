# Health Assistant
**This project is a web application that empowers individuals to take a more proactive role in their health by leveraging machine learning for disease risk assessment.**

Developed using Streamlit, this user-friendly platform caters to individuals with no prior technical experience. 

**Users simply provide basic data points, and "Health Assistant" generates predictions on the likelihood of developing three common diseases:** 
- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease.

These insights can serve as a springboard for further investigation and potentially lead to earlier diagnoses. Early detection is paramount for effective disease management, and "Health Assistant" aspires to contribute to improved health outcomes by promoting preventative measures and timely intervention.

This analysis utilizes Python, Google Colab, Spyder on Anaconda, and Streamlit for their suitability in developing the "Health Assistant" web application. We focus on three key areas:

1] **Development and Model Training:**
-	Python: The core programming language. Python excels in data science and machine learning tasks. Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn provide tools for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
-	Google Colab: A cloud-based Python environment. It eliminates the need for local software installation and offers free access to powerful hardware (GPUs) ideal for training computationally intensive machine learning models. However, it requires internet connectivity and has limited storage for long-term projects.

2] **Web Application Development:**
-	Streamlit: A Python framework for creating web applications. Streamlit simplifies development compared to traditional frameworks. Leverage existing Python code and data analysis results to build interactive data apps with minimal coding. However, customization options are limited compared to full-fledged frameworks, and the community is smaller.

3] **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
-	Spyder on Anaconda: A user-friendly IDE specifically designed for scientific computing with Python. Anaconda pre-installs essential scientific computing libraries. Spyder offers features like code completion, debugging tools, and variable inspection, streamlining your development process. However, it requires local software installation.

**Output Examples of the Web Application are as follows:**
